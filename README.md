# Mentora

Mentora is a decentralized marketplace for mentorship. By directly connecting those who want to pass on knowledge and advice (mentors) with those who want to receive it (mentees), Mentora helps mentees shortcut learning curves to rapidly attain goals while providing mentors with unhindered market opportunities.

## The Mentora System
The Mentora system is built on top of Ethereum and uses an Angular web app interface hosted on IPFS.  Utilising smart contracts to facilitate mentor/mentee relationships and interaction, Mentora eliminates the traditional middle man structure found in other learning marketplaces. This means individuals gain direct access to mentors who are eager to pass on their knowledge on their terms. There is no centralized company setting prices or siphoning off exorbitant fees from creators.

*Full Disclosure: Mentora will eventually establish fair transaction fees to help facilitate ongoing development. They will be implemented using smart contracts and therefore 100% transparent.*

Mentora is aiming to provide opportunities for both mentors and mentees:

### Mentors

Anyone desiring to pass on knowledge is a potential mentor. Mentora provides mentors with a platform to connect with potential mentees to create courses, deliver content, and promote themselves to potential mentees (people who are looking for a mentor in specific subject). They can offer a variety of mentoring services including online and offline mentorship opportunities, all brokered directly with interested mentees.  They can choose to transfer ownership rights or license their content to create mentorship networks.  All is handled on Ethereum, meaning content ownership verification is possible helping to prevent issues of theft or misappropriation.

### Mentees

The quickest way to attain a goal is to be mentored by someone who has already done what you want to do. Being a mentee means your mentor will be able to help you avoid the pitfalls and focus on what works best (or at least what worked best for them). Mentora provides a mentor marketplace where potential mentees can locate the best mentors in their desired field. A mentor/mentee relationship can form based on established terms that are enforced by the underlying blockchain technology.
